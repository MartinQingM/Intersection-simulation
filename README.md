# SUMO-Matlab-intersection_simulation
Trying to build a intersection assistant driving system simulation based on SUMO and TraCI4Matlab

To run this simple simulation, you need to install the following software:

Matlab2016a
SUMO 0.32.0
traci4matlab-API

You can have the following results:

A realtime Speed-time graph
A realtime Speed-Distance graph
A realtime Fuelconsumption-Distance graph

You can consider this as a tutorial of Traci4Matlab ^ ^

Still in progress...
