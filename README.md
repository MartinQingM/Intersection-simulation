# Intersection-simulation
Trying to build a trafic intersection assistant driving system simulation based on SUMO and TraCI4Matlab

Sorry for all the notations are in Chinese, have't got the time to do the translation.

To run this simple simulation, you need to install the following software:

* Matlab2016a;
* SUMO 0.32.0;
* traci4matlab-API;

You can have the following results:

* A realtime Speed-time graph;
* A realtime Speed-Distance graph;
* A realtime Fuelconsumption-Distance graph;

Here are some example of the figure:

<div align=center><img width="400" src="https://github.com/OriginPower/Intersection-simulation/blob/master/image/3.png"/></div>

Here are some useful websites.
* [SUMO Official Document](http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Simulation_of_Urban_MObility_-_Wiki)
* [TraCI4Matlab](https://ww2.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/44805-traci4matlab)

run **intersection.m** to start.

You can consider this as a tutorial of Traci4Matlab ^ ^
