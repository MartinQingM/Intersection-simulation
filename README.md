# Intersection-simulation
Trying to build a trafic intersection assistant driving system simulation based on SUMO and TraCI4Matlab

To run this simple simulation, you need to install the following software:

* Matlab2016a;
* SUMO 0.32.0;
* traci4matlab-API;

You can have the following results:

* A realtime Speed-time graph;
* A realtime Speed-Distance graph;
* A realtime Fuelconsumption-Distance graph;

Here are some useful websites.
* [SUMO Official Document](http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Simulation_of_Urban_MObility_-_Wiki)
* [TraCI4Matlab](https://ww2.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/44805-traci4matlab)

You can consider this as a tutorial of Traci4Matlab ^ ^

Still in progress...
